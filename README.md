## Professional Highlights

At **Riverus Technology Solutions**, as a Quality Assurance Engineer, I led test planning, UAT, and exploratory testing for a contract lifecycle management platform, significantly reducing post-release defects. I automated UI and API tests using **Selenium, Python, and Behave**, which greatly reduced manual testing efforts and improved test execution speed. I also established validation procedures on **AWS (S3, EC2, CloudWatch)**, authored comprehensive test cases, and leveraged **SQL and debugging skills** to accelerate defect resolution. In another major initiative at Riverus, I engineered a **Selenium-Java-TestNG automation framework** that covered over 800 regression and smoke test cases—dramatically improving execution speed and test accuracy. I also piloted **API and SQL data validation strategies** to strengthen data pipeline reliability and reporting accuracy, while applying both **white-box and black-box testing techniques** to enhance product quality.

At **KPOINT Technologies**, as a Senior Software Engineer, I revamped the test automation framework for a video and audio streaming platform, mentoring junior engineers and automating over 50 high-priority test cases within the first month. I built a robust **Selenium-Ruby-Cucumber BDD framework with Page Object Model (POM)** that significantly reduced regression testing time. I enhanced CI/CD testing by integrating tools like **Jenkins, Docker, and Kibana**, leading to faster and more stable deployments. I also explored additional automation tools like **Playwright**, and actively promoted **Agile Scrum practices**, improving team collaboration and accelerating delivery cycles.

### First Trial Project: Swag Labs (Python + Selenium + Jenkins)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Selenium, Jenkins
- **Goal:** This project is a basic demonstration of using **Selenium WebDriver with Python** to automate UI testing of a web application. It performs a test on [https://www.saucedemo.com] and then runs test in a CI/CD jenkins pipeline. 

## What This Script Does

- Opens Chrome browser and navigates to SauceDemo login page
- Logs in with test credentials
- Adds a product to the cart
- Verifies that the product is successfully added
- Navigates to the cart page
- Verifies the item is in the cart
- Closes the browser

## How It Works

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It allows you to simulate user actions like clicks, typing, and navigation on websites.

## What is a WebDriver?

A WebDriver is a bridge between Selenium and the web browser. It sends commands from your script to the browser. For Chrome, we use **ChromeDriver**.

---

## Setup Instructions

## 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python is installed, then install Selenium: pip install selenium

## 2. Download ChromeDriver
Go to: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

Download the version that matches your Chrome browser

Add the chromedriver to your system PATH or place it in the project folder

## CI/CD Integration with Jenkins

This project integrates with **Jenkins** using a **Pipeline-as-Code** approach. A custom `Jenkinsfile` is provided that automates the entire testing process.

### Jenkinsfile Overview

The Jenkins pipeline performs the following steps:

####  Environment Setup (Windows)
- Adds Python and pip to the system `PATH`
- Sets variables for:
  - `SELENIUM_TEST_DIR`: Location of the test script
  - `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`: Path to the ChromeDriver executable

#### Install Dependencies
- Echoes environment variables for debug
- Prints Python and pip versions
- Installs Selenium using `pip`

#### Run Selenium Test
- Runs `saucedemo_sanity_tests.py` from the defined test directory
- Uses Chrome in **headless mode**
- Passes Chrome options and ChromeDriver path to the script

#### Post Actions
- Always prints a message indicating the test has finished

# File Upload Automation with Playwright and Node.js

This project demonstrates **automated file upload testing** using **Playwright**. The script navigates to a sample file upload page, uploads a file, and verifies if the upload was successful.

## Project Overview

This project automates the process of uploading a file on the **"The Internet"** website ([https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload)) using Playwright, a powerful tool for browser automation.

### What the script does:
1. Launches a Chromium browser in **headed mode** (visible browser).
2. Navigates to the **upload page**.
3. Uploads a file (`testFile.txt`).
4. Submits the form and verifies the success message and the uploaded file.
5. Waits for **2 seconds** before closing the browser to allow observation of the process.

### Technologies Used:
- **Playwright** for browser automation.
- **Node.js** and **npm** for environment setup.

# Download File Automation with Playwright and Node.js

This project demonstrates **automated file download testing** using **Playwright**. The script navigates to a file download page, downloads a file, and verifies the download process.

## What the Script Does

1. **Launches the Chromium browser** in headed mode (visible browser).
2. **Navigates to the file download page** on [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download).
3. **Listens for the download event** triggered by clicking the file link.
4. **Downloads the file** (`logback.xml`) to a specified local directory (`downloads`).
5. **Waits for 5 seconds** to ensure the download process completes.
6. **Logs the download path** to the console.
7. **Closes the browser** after the download is complete.


## Installation Instructions

npm install playwright
npm install @playwright/test

To run the test: npx playwright test upload_file_test.js

## Add a Test File

Ensure that you have a file named testFile.txt in the same directory as your script or modify the path to match your file location.

# Selenium Automation Project TDD for Formy Demo Site

This project is built using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to automate UI tests for the [Formy Project Demo Website](https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/) using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestNG**.

## What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development process where tests are written **before** the actual implementation. In the context of automation, TDD helps:

- Clearly define expected behaviors upfront  
- Write reliable, repeatable test cases  
- Build robust and maintainable test suites

This project demonstrates that by starting with test methods that define what the UI should do, and building the automation code around those expectations.

## What This Project Does

The automation covers the following scenarios:

- **Form Submission**  
  Fills out a form and validates a success message.

- **Autocomplete Field**  
  Enters an address using the autocomplete input and checks the value.

- **Checkbox Interaction**  
  Selects a checkbox and verifies it’s checked.

All tests use **explicit waits** to ensure elements are interactable, and `Thread.sleep()` has been added temporarily to visually observe each test step.

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Maven
- ChromeDriver (v134+)

## Maven Project Structure

This is a **Maven project**, and all dependencies are managed through the `pom.xml`.
