## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

Hey there! I'm a passionate Software Quality Engineer with over six years of experience making sure software doesn‚Äôt just work‚Äîbut works flawlessly. My expertise spans **test planning, test scenario design, test execution, and automation**, all crucial to maintaining software quality throughout release cycles. From functional and non-functional testing to CI/CD integrations, I thrive in **building efficient, automated workflows that minimize manual effort and maximize reliability**.

What defines my QA mindset? It‚Äôs a **strategic approach to testing**‚Äî where every decision is backed by test coverage value‚Äîensuring we test what matters most, avoid redundancy, and maintain high confidence in releases.

- ‚úÖ **Test planning & strategy creation** aligned with business goals  
- ‚úÖ **Designing high-impact test cases and scenarios** that catch edge cases early  
- ‚úÖ **Executing and managing functional, non-functional, regression, and exploratory testing cycles**  
- ‚úÖ **Deciding what to automate and what not to‚Äîbased on stability, repeatability, and cost-benefit analysis**  
- ‚úÖ **Performance testing using tools like JMeter**, identifying bottlenecks before users do  
- ‚úÖ **Collaborating cross-functionally** to embed quality into the entire SDLC  

## üè¢ Professional Highlights

At **Riverus Technology Solutions**, as a Quality Assurance Engineer, I led test planning, UAT, and exploratory testing for a contract lifecycle management platform, significantly reducing post-release defects. I automated UI and API tests using **Selenium, Python, and Behave**, which greatly reduced manual testing efforts and improved test execution speed. I also established validation procedures on **AWS (S3, EC2, CloudWatch)**, authored comprehensive test cases, and leveraged **SQL and debugging skills** to accelerate defect resolution. In another major initiative at Riverus, I engineered a **Selenium-Java-TestNG automation framework** that covered over 800 regression and smoke test cases‚Äîdramatically improving execution speed and test accuracy. I also piloted **API and SQL data validation strategies** to strengthen data pipeline reliability and reporting accuracy, while applying both **white-box and black-box testing techniques** to enhance product quality.

At **KPOINT Technologies**, as a Senior Software Engineer, I revamped the test automation framework for a video and audio streaming platform, mentoring junior engineers and automating over 50 high-priority test cases within the first month. I built a robust **Selenium-Ruby-Cucumber BDD framework with Page Object Model (POM)** that significantly reduced regression testing time. I enhanced CI/CD testing by integrating tools like **Jenkins, Docker, and Kibana**, leading to faster and more stable deployments. I also explored additional automation tools like **Playwright**, and actively promoted **Agile Scrum practices**, improving team collaboration and accelerating delivery cycles.

## What I Bring

I bring **end-to-end quality ownership**‚Äîfrom ideation to production, from manual validations to intelligent automation. I don‚Äôt just write scripts‚ÄîI **engineer test strategies** that scale with your product and team. Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing my **Master‚Äôs in Management Information Systems at the University at Buffalo**, staying ahead of emerging tech trends while honing my ability to bridge the gap between technology and business. I‚Äôm deeply invested in **test automation, cloud testing, and CI/CD optimization**‚Äîand always eager to connect with like-minded professionals.

## What's in Here?

This repository contains a collection of my automation testing projects, showcasing my ability to work with different tools, frameworks, and methodologies. Each project includes setup details, test cases, and CI/CD configurations.

### üîπ First Trial Project: Swag Labs (Python + Selenium + Jenkins)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Selenium, Jenkins
- **Goal:** This project is a basic demonstration of using **Selenium WebDriver with Python** to automate UI testing of a web application. It performs a test on [https://www.saucedemo.com]. 

## ‚úÖ What This Script Does

- Opens Chrome browser and navigates to SauceDemo login page
- Logs in with test credentials
- Adds a product to the cart
- Verifies that the product is successfully added
- Navigates to the cart page
- Verifies the item is in the cart
- Closes the browser

## üß† How It Works

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It allows you to simulate user actions like clicks, typing, and navigation on websites.

## What is a WebDriver?

A WebDriver is a bridge between Selenium and the web browser. It sends commands from your script to the browser. For Chrome, we use **ChromeDriver**.

## üíª Setup Instructions

## 1. Install Dependencies
## 2. Download ChromeDriver
Go to: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

Download the version that matches your Chrome browser

Add the chromedriver to your system PATH or place it in the project folder

Ensure Python is installed, then install Selenium: pip install selenium
