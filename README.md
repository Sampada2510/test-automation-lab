### Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio "All-In-One-QA"
This repository serves as my portfolio, showcasing a collection of interesting QA automation projects using Java, Python, Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Playwright, and CI/CD with Jenkins. It includes detailed documentation for learning and reference, demonstrating my expertise in automation, cloud-based testing, and test optimization

## About Me

Hey there! I'm a passionate Software Quality Engineer with over six years of experience making sure software doesnâ€™t just workâ€”but works flawlessly. My expertise spans **test planning, scenario design, execution, and automation**, all crucial to maintaining software quality throughout release cycles. From functional and non-functional testing to CI/CD integrations, I thrive in **building efficient, automated workflows that minimize manual effort and maximize reliability**.

At **Riverus Technology Solutions**, I spearheaded test automation for a contract lifecycle management SaaS platform, **significantly reducing post-release defects** and optimizing test execution speeds. I automated UI and API testing using **Selenium, Python, and Behave**, cutting manual testing efforts while ensuring broader coverage. My role extended to cloud-based testing, where I established validation procedures via **AWS S3, EC2, and CloudWatch**, enhancing system performance and monitoring. Additionally, I collaborated with DevOps to **seamlessly integrate testing into Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines**, reducing deployment failures and ensuring smooth releases.

Prior to that, at **KPOINT Technologies**, I revamped test automation frameworks for a large-scale video streaming platform. Leading a **15-member automation team**, I developed a **Selenium-Ruby-Cucumber BDD framework with Page Object Model (POM)**, which streamlined test maintenance and cut regression testing time in half. My experience also includes performance testing using **JMeter**, API testing with **Postman and Swagger**, and optimizing deployments with **Docker and Jenkins**.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Management Information Systems at the University at Buffalo**, staying ahead of emerging tech trends while honing my ability to bridge the gap between technology and business. Iâ€™m deeply invested in **test automation, cloud testing, and CI/CD optimization**â€”and always eager to connect with like-minded professionals. If youâ€™re passionate about quality engineering, letâ€™s chat! ðŸš€
